v1.0: First Release
v1.1: Support for dymanic length indexes
v1.2: Start and ending quotes removed from ADVSNMPVALUE
      advsnmp.discovery will return an empty JSON object when there is no INDEX
      quotes and backslashes will be escaped
v1.3: Changed the JSON object array name to 'data'. The array name changed with Zabbix v2.0.0rc1.
      Removed the JSON array name workaround for ZBX-4725, it is no longer needed.
v2.0: BUGFIX: Removed a bug where JSON object is not printed correctly when INDEX value is 0.
      Thanks to cmammoli for reporting the issue and providing a fix.
